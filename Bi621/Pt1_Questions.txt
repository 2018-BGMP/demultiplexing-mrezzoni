Part 1:

1.
2 Biological reads: 1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz & 1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz
R1 = forward --> better quality (see mean scores plots)
R4 = reverse --> worse, has been on sequencer longer
2 Index reads: 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz & 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz

a)
	see attached figures

b)
	The averages of the average quality scores for R1 and R4 are about 39 and 37, respectively. The averages
	of the average quality scores for R2 and R3 are about 36 and 35, respectively. It seems reasonable to 
	designate the quality score cutoff around 35 for biological sequencing reads, as these are on average
	relatively high quality and will be mostly kept. Additionally, there may be some nucleotide ambiguity
	in biological sequencing reads, as they may prove useful for later analysis. The quality score cutoff
	for index reads should be higher than the sequencing reads, perhaps 37, as you want less ambiguity in 
	the nucleotides that are responsible for labeling your sequences.

c)
	code for R2: zcat 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '2~4p' | grep 'N' | wc -l
	number of Ns in R2: 3,976,613
	code for R3: zcat 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '2~4p' | grep 'N' | wc -l
	number of Ns in R3: 3,328,051
